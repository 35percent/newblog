Gloucester Grove estate was part demolished and part refurbished. It originally consisted of 1,210 flats and maisonettes distributed in 29 blocks, from three to ten storeys high. Only 3 of the 29 blocks have been retained and refurbished.

Gloucester Grove fronts Burgess Park. According to [Municipal Dreams](https://municipaldreams.wordpress.com/2016/10/11/the-five-estates-peckham-part-one/), of the Five Estates it is _'the most striking architecturally, notable for its long, linked, snake-like construction... between three and eight storeys in height joined by high, semi-circular, glass-tiled entrances containing stairways and lifts which provide a deliberately and eye-catchingly ‘modernist’ look..'_.
