This is the old Crown Street depot in Camberwell:

It sits on a parcel of council land which used to be part of the Bethwin? estate and its Bethwin adventure playground.

In 2013 permission was granted (ref:13/AP/0651) for the construction of 6 blocks. Block 2 (pictured below) is on the former Crown Street depot site.

It's part of a wider development along Crown Street involving other parcels of land in different ownership.

The placard on the hoardings outside the depot site said that the development was a partnership between Southwark Council, ASRA housing association and funded by the Mayor of London.

In 2016, ASRA applied for retrospective planning permission because none of the 6 blocks in the scheme had been built according to the consent.

Breaches included:

Amenity spaces were not provided on the rooves as required.

Wheelchair access homes were not provided as required.

Homes did not meet Code For Sustainable Homes level 4 as required. 

Basement parking for the disabled units was not provided as required.

Building heights were up to 3m higher than consented.

Building plots were built out wider than consented.

Retrospective consent was granted by delegated officer decision.

In 2016, plot 6 - the entirely private block, was sold as a partially completed schemes (with s106 breaches acknowledged):

In November 2020, we [approached](https://mobile.twitter.com/JohnsonSitu/status/1323641097009143808) the then Cabinet member Cllr Johnson Situ asking what was going on with the scheme, which had clearly stalled.

He replied saying that he would look into it and get back to us:

Despite several chase up tweets and Direct Messages, Cllr Situ never got back to us.

Apathy or Incompetence?

Is it that they don't care about having signed over public land in return for some affordable housing which is sitting vacant? or is it that they don't actually know. 
Maybe the original development agreement got lost in their archives?
Maybe they don't keep track of all the development agreements they have signed because they have full trust in developers to deliver what they promised?..
