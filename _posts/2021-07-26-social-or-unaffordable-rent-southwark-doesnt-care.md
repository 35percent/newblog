These flats have just come up for let on Southwark's Homesearch web portal (Choice-based lettings system) for families on its waiting list.

They are in a building called 'Gutenberg Court' on Grange Road and is managed by a \*Southwark-based\* housing association "[Paragon Asra](https://pahousing.co.uk/)".

It's one of the [43 schemes](http://35percent.org/img/section106_tenure_breaches.pdf) that we reported to the Ombudsman 5 years ago as having breached S106 tenure provisions. Note that Paragon Asra features also elsewhere in our list.

The scheme was [approved](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=11/AP/1390&system=DC) in 2011, which provided for demolition of the existing printworks and construction of 38 homes of which 9 social rent and 4 intermediate (11/AP/1390).

The [planning statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!2CO3QCC5LOSODKKx0Cx6Qg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) and the officer's report (attached) clearly states 9 SOCIAL RENT homes (see paras 45-49).

The Mayor's AHP funding spreadsheet (also attached) shows that Paragon (previously called Leicester housing association) was granted GLA funding for 9 AFFORDABLE RENT units and 4 shared ownership. Note that the prospective rents listed were up to 52% market rent for a 1-bed at Â£154 per week.

So five years on from our original Ombudsman complaint, one of the schemes we complained about is continuing to rent out homes that were approved as social rent for twice as much as they should be charging under the planning consent!
