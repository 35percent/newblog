224 homes have been earmarked for demolition on Southwark's Ledbury estate off the Old Kent Road.

The estate was identified as suffering from fire safety issues following the Grenfell disaster.

In April 2021, Southwark Council balloted residents on whether their homes should be demolished or remediation works commissioned. 56% of eligible residents took part and 86% of these voted for demolition.

[Council briefing papers](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s100047/Report%20Ledbury%20Estate%20Towers.pdf) confirm that as of May 2021, of the 224 homes on the estate, 23 secure tenants remain, 18 are being occupied by those with leasehold interests and 103 are being used as temporary accommodation.

The same report confirms that the Mayor has allocated £27m funding towards the redevelopment of the estate. It is unclear what the cost to Southwark Council will be.

No cost/benefit analysis has been undertaken to evaluate the cost of remediation works against the cost of demolition and rebuild.
